# INFOW18_FinalProject

For our final project in the Python Bridge Course we used open source data to explore felony violence and school violence in NYC from 2006-2015. This repository contains the python notebook with our final analysis and the pdf report summarizing our findings. The original data sources can also be found at the following sites:


Felony Data: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-7-major-felony-incidents

School Safety Reports (VARDIS): http://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/school_safety/school_safety_data_reporting.html
