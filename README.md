The Proposal

With your group come up with a 2 page proposal about the questions that you intend to ask of the data. This should include:

Initial plots, figures or tables.
References to column names and the analysis that they may provide.
Additional datasets that you plan on including in your analysis like the weather data. This means links, columns that you'll join on, etc.
What you plan to cover in the final report and how you plan on organizing it.
Who is in your group.
You should have started digging into your analysis at this point and the proposal is an expression of its viability to the instructors. We should have the sense that this is something you will be able to deliver on (and that the data will support you in doing so).

THE PROPOSAL IS DUE BY APRIL 12.

Data Repository: Use "git clone [link]" to create a new local repository we can all share. Repository is found here. Note that the data is NOT in the repository (too large). https://github.com/mmillervedam/INFOW18_FinalProject

Data: The goal is to combine these datasets by "borough" to get more interesting revelations from our analysis for the final project.

Felony Data: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-7-major-felony-incidents

School Safety: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-safety-report-8067a

Population: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/new-york-city-population-by-boroughs-fd2c0
